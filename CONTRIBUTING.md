# Contributing to the Raku Advent calendar

## Background

See current and previous Advent article entries
[here](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/) and [here](https://raku-advent.blog).

## Instructions

1. Get a Raku Wordpress account from an admin on IRC #raku or #raku-dev (librasteve, timotimo, moritz, tbrowder ...).

2. Write your article as a DRAFT on the Raku Advent Wordpress site.

3. Use [Hilite::Simple](https://raku.land/zef:librasteve/Hilite::Simple) to highlight any raku or rakudoc code in your article (paste the results into a Wordpress HTML widget and use Preview to check it).

4. When your article is ready for publication, you can announce it on the IRC \#raku channel and someone with the proper credentials will schedule its live publication at the proper time.
